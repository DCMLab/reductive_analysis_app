Test verovio for interactive applications (rerendering times seem slow?)

Format for storing the induced graphs (MEI)

The basic idea is to have a facility to load a MEI/MXL file, and to render
it to a webpage.

The basic interaction the user does with the score is to select several
notes and reduce them to a subset. This also adds a grouping to these
notes, which in a schenkerian graph likely would be illustrated using a
slur or tie (possibly with P/N/IN notations etc.)

The reduced notes are greyed out as a first step.

After a suitable set of reductions has been made to the score, the user can
click a button to rerender the score with the reduced notes removed, and
can then add a new set of reductions, and repeat until some sort of Urlinie
is achieved.

In the code, this is accomplished by, storing the following information:

The original score (and its rendering).

The reduction sets (essentially directed hyperedges).

The intermediate scores (and their renderings).

And, of course a bunch of other things.
