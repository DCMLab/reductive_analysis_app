Test verovio for interactive applications (rerendering times seem slow?)

Format for storing the induced graphs (MEI)

The basic idea is to have a facility to load a MEI/MXL file, and to render
it to a webpage.

The basic interaction the user does with the score is to select several
notes and reduce them to a subset. This also adds a grouping to these
notes, which in a schenkerian graph likely would be illustrated using a
slur or tie (possibly with P/N/IN notations etc.)

The reduced notes are greyed out as a first step.

After a suitable set of reductions has been made to the score, the user can
click a button to rerender the score with the reduced notes removed, and
can then add a new set of reductions, and repeat until some sort of Urlinie
is achieved.

In the code, this is accomplished by, storing the following information:

The original score (and its rendering).

The reduction sets (essentially directed hyperedges).

The intermediate scores (and their renderings).

And, of course a bunch of other things.



Steps:

1. Load MEI/XML

1.5. Get MEI/XML back

2. Mark notes

3. Mark notes and join them with lines

4. Mark notes and choose some to be more salient

5. Save edge information in XML structure

6. Get saved edge information back from downloaded data

7. Hide some notes and re-render

8. Build dependency DAG of edge relations

9. Automatically choose edges to hide

10. Slide through more or less reduced version of the score
