/**
 * This element is used for accurate IntersectionObserver measurements. It is
 * needed because the intersection ratio of the layer containing the score
 * is often very small because the layer is wider than the viewport. At
 * the end, the observer fails to intersect at the defined threshold
 * but it can be solved using an element havng the same height as
 * a layer but a 1px width that will never mess with the ratio.
 * The use of flex and sticky isnâ€™t ideal but is currently a
 * okay-temp way to intersect while panning horizontally.
